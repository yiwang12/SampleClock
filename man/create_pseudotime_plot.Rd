\title{Creates visualization plots for pseudotime analysis using either CCA or TSCAN methods}
\usage{
create_pseudotime_plot(
  sample_info,
  rd,
  mclustobj,
  title,
  slope = NULL,
  method = c("cca", "tscan")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_info}{Data frame containing sample metadata and pseudotime information}

\item{rd}{Reduced dimension coordinates (typically PCA or other dimensionality reduction)}

\item{mclustobj}{Clustering object from TSCAN analysis (required for TSCAN method)}

\item{title}{Main title for the combined plot}

\item{slope}{Slope for CCA projection line (required for CCA method)}

\item{method}{Visualization method to use - either 'cca' or 'tscan'

Details:
For CCA method:
\itemize{
\item Creates two plots showing PC1 vs PC2:
\enumerate{
\item Points colored by disease severity
\item Points colored by study origin
}
\item Includes projection line with specified slope
}

For TSCAN method:
\itemize{
\item Creates three plots:
\enumerate{
\item Points colored by cluster state
\item Points colored by disease severity
\item Points colored by study origin
}
\item Includes minimum spanning tree connecting cluster centers
}

All plots use consistent color schemes:
\itemize{
\item Severity: Green (Healthy) -> Blue (Mild) -> Orange (Moderate) -> Red (Severe)
\item Studies: Preset color palette for 12 different studies
}

Returns:
A combined plot arranged using patchwork with shared title}
