\title{Select highly variable genes (HVGs) for integration between RNA and ATAC data}
\usage{
select_HVG_for_integration(obj.RNA_Con, obj.ATAC_Con)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj.RNA_Con}{RNA data object containing gene expression values}

\item{obj.ATAC_Con}{ATAC data object containing accessibility scores}
}
\value{
Character vector of gene names identified as highly variable in both modalities
}
\description{
Identifies highly variable genes by combining information from both RNA and ATAC data.
Selects top variable genes from each modality and returns their intersection.
}
\details{
The function:
\enumerate{
\item Calculates Z-scores for both RNA and ATAC data
\item Selects top 10000 variable genes from ATAC data
\item Selects top 5000 variable genes from RNA data
\item Returns intersection of both sets
}
}
